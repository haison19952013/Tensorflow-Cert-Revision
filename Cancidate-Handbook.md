## Exam details
### Criteria
- The exam tests students in their ability to solve problems by building models using TensorFlow
2.x.
### Skill checklist
- The TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam will test you on this set of skills.
1. TensorFlow developer skills
You need to demonstrate that you understand how to develop software programs using TensorFlow and that you can find the information you need to work as an ML practitioner. You need to:

- [ ] Know how to program in Python, resolve Python issues, and compile and run Python programs
in PyCharm.
- [ ] Know how to ůnd information about TensorFlow APIs, including how to find guides and API
references on tensorŲow.org.
- [ ] Know how to debug, investigate, and solve error messages from the TensorFlow API.
- [ ] Know how to search beyond tensorŲow.org, as and when necessary, to solve your TensorFlow
questions.
- [ ] Know how to create ML models using TensorFlow where the model size is reasonable for the
problem being solved.
- [ ] Know how to save ML models and check the model file size.
- [ ] Understand the compatibility discrepancies between diŦerent versions of TensorFlow.
  
2. Building and training neural network models using TensorFlow 2.x
You need to understand the foundational principles of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
using TensorFlow 2.x. You need to know how to:
- [ ] Use TensorFlow 2.x.
- [ ] Build, compile and train machine learning (ML) models using TensorFlow.
- [ ] Preprocess data to get it ready for use in a model.
- [ ] Use models to predict results.
- [ ] Build sequential models with multiple layers.
- [ ] Build and train models for binary classification.
- [ ] Build and train models for multi-class categorization.
- [ ] Plot loss and accuracy of a trained model.
- [ ] Identify strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.
- [ ] Use pretrained models (transfer learning).
- [ ] Extract features from pre-trained models.
- [ ] Ensure that inputs to a model are in the correct shape.
- [ ] Ensure that you can match test data to the input shape of a neural network.
- [ ] Ensure you can match output data of a neural network to specified input shape for test data.
- [ ] Understand batch loading of data.
- [ ] Use callbacks to trigger the end of training cycles.
- [ ] Use datasets from different sources.
- [ ] Use datasets in different formats, including json and csv.
- [ ] Use datasets from tf.data.datasets.
  
3.  Image classification
You need to understand how to build image recognition and object detection models with deep neural
networks and convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow 2.x. You need to know how to:
- [ ] Define Convolutional neural networks with Conv2D and pooling layers.
- [ ] Build and train models to process real-world image datasets.
- [ ] Understand how to use convolutions to improve your neural network.
- [ ] Use real-world images in different shapes and sizes..
- [ ] Use image augmentation to prevent overfitting.
- [ ] Use ImageDataGenerator.
- [ ] Understand how ImageDataGenerator labels images based on the directory structure.

4. Natural language processing (NLP)
You need to understand how to use neural networks to solve natural language processing problems
using TensorFlow. You need to know how to:
- [ ] Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.
- [ ] Prepare text to use in TensorFlow models.
- [ ] Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using binary categorization
- [ ] Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using multi-class categorization
- [ ] Use word embeddings in your TensorFlow model.
- [ ] Use LSTMs in your model to classify text for either binary or multi-class categorization.
- [ ] Add RNN and GRU layers to your model.
- [ ] Use RNNS, LSTMs, GRUs and CNNs in models that work with text.
- [ ] Train LSTMs on existing text to generate text (such as songs and poetry)

5. Time series, sequences and predictions
You need to understand how to solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow. You need to
know how to:
- [ ] Train, tune and use time series, sequence and prediction models.
- [ ] Train models to predict values for both univariate and multivariate time series.
- [ ] Prepare data for time series learning.

- [ ] Identify when to use trailing versus centred windows.
- [ ] Use TensorFlow for forecasting.
- [ ] Prepare features and labels.
- [ ] Identify and compensate for sequence bias.
- [ ] Adjust the learning rate dynamically in time series, sequence and prediction models.

### Exam environment
See ["Set up your environment to take the TensorFlow Developer Certificate Exam"](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf) for more details
on how to make sure your computer is ready to take the exam..
- You can take the exam from any computer that supports the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) requirements,
anywhere there is internet, any time. There is no need to go to a test center.
- This exam is an online, performance-based test that requires implementing TensorFlow
models using TensorFlow within a PyCharm environment.
- The exam duration is 5 hours.
- In order to take the exam you will install the TensorFlow Exam plugin using the PyCharm
IDE. We recommend you install the PyCharm IDE and become familiar with using it prior
to taking the exam. [Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) are the system requirements for the PyCharm IDE

### Exam time limit
- You have 5 hours to complete the exam.

- If you don't submit your exam before the 5 hours has elapsed, your exam will be auto submitted.
This in itself does not cause you to fail the exam, but you will only be graded for the questions for
which you have already submitted and tested models during the course of taking the exam.

### Exam URL to take the exam
- Once you have read this document in its entirety, you can start the process of purchasing the
exam [here](https://app.trueability.com/google-certificates/tensorflow-developer).
- The last day to purchase the exam is April 30 2024.

### Candidate identiůcation and authentication
- You are required to provide a non-expired Primary ID that contains your photograph, signature and
full name (see acceptable forms of ID in the table below).

- If your full name on their Primary ID contains non-latin characters, then you must ALSO provide a
non-expired Secondary ID containing your full name in Latin Characters and signature, OR a notarized English translation of your Primary ID along with the non-latin character Primary ID.
